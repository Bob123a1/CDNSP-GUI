## Translation (Modifications)
You can now suggest translations to your local language which you believe could be translated in a better way, make a fork of my Git, and edit your changes on your commit and submit a pull-request! 
In order to translate: You need to choose your language's [ISO 639-1 Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) folder and edit the language.po file inside the folder, submit a pull-request to the main branch when you're done!
